Persona iOS sdk
---------------

This project was originally based on the BrowserID code by Stefan Arentz, but has been significantly modified.

This is an sdk, an example app, and a trivial server, showing how to use persona sign-in with iOS, and includes UI for iPod/iPhone/iPad. The code assumes iOS 6, and ARC, and requires the trivial server 'proxy.js' running on your local machine:

> node proxy.js

It opens two local ports, pretending to be a backend server/website, trying to authenticate a user.

What does this code do:
-----------------------
- show you how to use Persona to authenticate users for your site from a native iOS application
- provide working UI for all current iOS devices.
- demonstrate the use of the lower level Persona Internal API
- uses extremely fake hard-coded session 'cookies' provided by proxy.js


What doesn't this code do:
--------------------------
- handle all error cases
- have any tests yet (oops)
- lots of other things, I suspect.  Patches welcome.
